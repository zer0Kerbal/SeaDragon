0.3 (2016-04-02) - The Sea-Recovery Update.
 - Increased crash tolerance of first stage engine and tank to 150 m/s to support oceanic crash-landing recovery.
 - Removed stack attachment node from end of skirt extension on second stage tank, and instead added it to second stage engine.
 - Added inflatable "recovery flare" to the first stage engine, and updated sample rockets to put it on action group 2.

0.2 (2016-03-28) - The Sea-Launch Update.
 - Increased crash tolerance considerably on all parts, to allow bouncing around in the water.
 - Added attachment node at bottom of first stage engine to allow attaching the ballast tank. 
 - Extended first stage tank's lower skirt, and removed extraneous attachment node corresponding to it.
 - Shortened first stage engine length (and updated sample rocket accordingly), after discovering miscalculation.
 - Reworked colliders for first and second stage main engines, and first stage tank.
 - Added ballast tank for sea launches.
 - Added SPH sample rocket with ballast tank. 
 - Updated VAB sample rocket to ignite the verniers at launch in the staging.
 - Added an animated bell extension for the second stage engine, and updated sample rockets to use it (action group 1).
 - Added custom smoke trail for first stage engine (known issue: runs regardless of air pressure).
 - Removed smoke trails from upper-stage engine + verniers (hydrogen burns cleanly).

0.1 (2016-03-25) - First test release.
 - Mostly complete. Using stock procedural fairing system. No ballast tanks. 
 - Known issue: Fairing "confetti" is rather deadly.
 - Known issue: Steering authority in upper stage is weak. Already artificially inflated though! (should be worse!)
