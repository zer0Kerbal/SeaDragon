Information:

The "Sea Dragon" was a proposed rocket design, that was intended to be built using shipyards, 
and launched from the ocean. Designed with inexpensive operatings costs in mind, it would have
used simple construction, but on a large scale. It was inteneded to be fueled at sea, and use
a nuclear aircraft carrier as the power source to generate the hydrogen and oxygen needed. While
the design was solid in many ways, it was also unusually ambitious, and perhaps required a bit
of insanity to truly appreciate. :)
